A modification for Plug.dj

Currently only supports autowoot and some ui adjustments, however boasts the backend features required for INFINITE COMPLEXITY.

Coming soon are features are versioning, better welcome message/help, 3rd party module loading, app store.

Thanks to my friends who have helped me fill in features, given brilliant suggestions, or written hilarious reviews on the chrome web store. I love you all!!!
